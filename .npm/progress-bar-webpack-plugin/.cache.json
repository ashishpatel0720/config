progress-bar-webpack-plugin\n![progress-bar-webpack-plugin](http://i.imgur.com/OIP1gnj.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm i -D progress-bar-webpack-plugin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nInclude the following in your Webpack config.\n\n```javascript\nvar ProgressBarPlugin = require('progress-bar-webpack-plugin');\n\n...\n\nplugins: [\n  new ProgressBarPlugin()\n]\n```\n\n## Options\n\nAccepts almost all of the same options as [node-progress](https://github.com/tj/node-progress#options).\n\n- `format` the format of the progress bar\n- `width` the displayed width of the progress bar defaulting to total\n- `complete` completion character defaulting to \"=\"\n- `incomplete` incomplete character defaulting to \" \"\n- `renderThrottle` minimum time between updates in milliseconds defaulting to 16\n- `clear` option to clear the bar on completion defaulting to true\n- `callback` optional function to call when the progress bar completes\n- `stream` the output stream defaulting to stderr\n- `summary` option to show summary of time taken defaulting to true\n- `summaryContent` optional custom summary message if summary option is false\n- `customSummary` optional function to display a custom summary (passed build time)\n\nThe `format` option accepts the following tokens:\n\n- `:bar` the progress bar itself\n- `:current` current tick number\n- `:total` total ticks\n- `:elapsed` time elapsed in seconds\n- `:percent` completion percentage\n- `:msg` current progress message\n\nThe default format uses the `:bar` and `:percent` tokens.\n\nUse [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) to sprinkle on a few colors.\n\nTo include the time elapsed and prevent the progress bar from being cleared on build completion:\n\n```javascript\nnew ProgressBarPlugin({\n  format: '  build [:bar] ' + chalk.green.bold(':percent') + ' (:elapsed seconds)',\n  clear: false\n})\n```\n\n##
