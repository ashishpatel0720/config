vuex-router-sync\n\n> Effortlessly keep vue-router and vuex store in sync.\n\n### Usage\n\n``` bash\n# the latest version works only with vue-router >= 2.0\nnpm install vuex-router-sync\n\n# for usage with vue-router < 2.0:\nnpm install vuex-router-sync@2\n```\n\n``` js\nimport { sync } from 'vuex-router-sync'\nimport store from './vuex/store' // vuex store instance\nimport router from './router' // vue-router instance\n\nsync(store, router) // done.\n\n// bootstrap your app...\n```\n\nYou can set a custom vuex module name\n\n```js\nsync(store, router, { moduleName: 'RouteModule' } )\n```\n\n\n### How does it work?\n\n- It adds a `route` module into the store, which contains the state representing the current route:\n\n  ``` js\n  store.state.route.path   // current path (string)\n  store.state.route.params // current params (object)\n  store.state.route.query  // current query (object)\n  ```\n\n- When the router navigates to a new route, the store's state is updated.\n\n- **`store.state.route` is immutable, because it is derived state from the URL, which is the source of truth**. You should not attempt to trigger navigations by mutating the route object. Instead, just call `$router.push()` or `$router.go()`. Note that you can do `$router.push({ query: {...}})` to update the query string on the current path.\n\n### License\n\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"yyx990803","email":"yyx990803@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-04-20T03:49:51.285Z","created":"2016-03-08T10:33:36.134Z","1.0.0":"2016-03-08T10:33:36.134Z","1.0.1":"2016-06-30T03:01:10.350Z","2.0.0":"2016-06-30T20:33:06.827Z","2.0.2":"2016-07-11T20:00:14.507Z","3.0.0":"2016-08-05T19:42:04.083Z","2.1.0":"2016-08-05T19:46:11.830Z","2.1.1":"2016-09-15T22:45:21.268Z","4.0.0":"2016-12-14T18:19:26.691Z","4.0.1":"2016-12-14T18:24:43.101Z","4.0.2":"2016-12-21T19:52:08.437Z","4.1.0":"2017-01-02T16:48:07.332Z","4.1.1":"2017-01-17T14:19:41.559Z","4.1.2":"2017-01-25T16:36:34.446Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync#readme","keywords":["vuex","vue-router","vue"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync.git"},"author":{"name":"Evan You"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"martinspinks":true,"foxted":true,"shadowlong":true,"heartnett":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"58f82fdf-44bd\""}
